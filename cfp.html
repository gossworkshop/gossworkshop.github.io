            <p>
                The study of gender and sexuality within online safety, privacy and security is critical to
                addressing gendered online harms such as intimate partner violence, image-based
                sexual abuse and other tech-facilitated harms. The Gender, Online Safety, Sexuality
                (GOSS) workshop aims to facilitate the sharing of ideas, stimulate conversations, and
                build collaborations - dedicated to creating space for current perspectives and future
                directions related to gender, sexuality, and online safety. GOSS seeks to bridge the
                social sciences with robust technical understandings of security and privacy - for
                enduring online safety for people of all genders and sexualities, and help to co-create
                meaningful steps to structure this subfield. By nurturing an interdisciplinary environment,
                this workshop aims to create a network of scholars committed to addressing a
                combination of:

                future planned research, and to specify their interest for the workshop. Participants are

            <p>
                There will be <b>two</b> types of submissions accepted for GOSS 2025, resulting in different 
                types of presentations during the workshop:
                <ul>
                    <li> position papers (1 page) &#8594; lightning talks</li>
                    <li> work-in-progress extended abstracts (2 pages) &#8594; WIP talks</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                One-page position papers (excluding optional references) should detail relevant previous 
                research you have completed or novel perspectives on gender and sexuality at the 
                intersection of online safety, privacy, and security, or otherwise specify your interest for the workshop. 
                You will be asked if you are comfortable with sharing
                your position papers in advance of the workshop, so attendees can familiarize
                themselves with the other attendees. You will also be asked if you would be
                interested in presenting a lightning talk on the content of your position paper. 
                Position paper submissions should not be anonymous. Upon review by the 
                program committee members, up to five participants will be invited to give lightning talks during the workshop.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Two-page extended abstracts of work-in-progress research should detail ongoing work on gender 
                and sexuality at the intersection of online safety, privacy, and security. 
                The goal of these submissions is to enable researchers (including early career researchers or at later career stages)
                to get feedback on work-in-progress research from the GOSS community. We aim to create a diverse, inclusive,
                and confidential space for workshop attendees to solicit feedback and gather ideas. 
                Seven WIP submissions will be invited for presentation at during the workshop.
                Extended abstracts of WIPs should be anonymous, but be advised that presentations during the workshop will not be anonymous.
            </p>
            <p>
                The titles of the five lightning talks and seven WIPs will be made available on the
                workshop website, and the position papers and extended abstracts agreed for sharing
                will be accessible on a shared repository. All participants must register for the workshop
                and at least one author of a submission must attend the workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions do not need to follow any submission templates. You will also be asked
                to indicate whether you are comfortable with us sharing your submission in advance of
                the workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions should be submitted as a PDF via the GOSS 2025 HotCRP: TBA
